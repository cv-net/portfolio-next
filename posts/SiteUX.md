#### Work Journal
+ Should I jsut do a Dendron?
+ Projects and related ode blogs easily linked? 
+ It's literally built in
+ But the point is to showcase mine, maybe I dont have to make absolutely everything tho
+ Idk, work your way up, always prioritize to meet the initial objective, not get sidetracked  by the possibility of doing more than I initially expected
+ Ok but
+ No actually thats what you should do, set up a Dendron and get on with react-journal-timer, CVN and OL
